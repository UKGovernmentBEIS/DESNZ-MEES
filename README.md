# DESNZ-MEES Alpha

## Warning
This is experimental code and not intended for commercial use.

## Repository Structure
This repo consists of two entirely independant code bases:
  - [data analysis](./src/data-analysis/) - python and jupyter scripts to load and analyse data, the DMS equivalent of this repo.
  - [data tool](./src/data-tool/) - ASP.NET app to display the data.

They are combined into a single code base as we were only supplied with a single repo. And it is alpha so not as important to get repo structure correct as it is to prove the individual areas of technology. The time was therefore spent on technology.
